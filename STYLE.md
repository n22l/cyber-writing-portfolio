# STYLE

- Audience: practitioners first; execs second. Lead with actions; background in an appendix.
- Voice: direct, active, specific. Ban weasel words: robust, state-of-the-art, revolutionary.
- Structure: one idea per section; each step starts with an imperative verb.
- Numbers: give ranges/units; include versions and dates (e.g., “SP 800-61 Rev. 3 (2025)”).
- Sources: cite primary docs (vendor docs, NIST, CISA/FBI). Avoid tertiary blogs for facts.
- Terms: “Microsoft Entra ID” (not “Azure AD”), “Conditional Access” (capitalized).
- Links: descriptive text; no bare URLs.
- Code/CLI: fenced blocks; minimal, tested examples or clearly labeled “example”.

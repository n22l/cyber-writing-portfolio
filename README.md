# Cybersecurity Writing Portfolio

Evidence-driven security documentation for practitioners and decision-makers — playbooks, policy drafts, and technical guides written to ship, not to impress.

Each sample includes:
- **Evidence Pack** – reproducible steps, artifacts, screenshots  
- **Controls Crosswalk** – mapped to NIST CSF, CIS, or OWASP frameworks  
- **Editorial Appendix** – assumptions, de-jargon, risk trade-offs  
- **Fact-check Log** – dated sources and version validation

> Every document ends with verified sources and a fact-check log.
